# Assignment #3

We pushed another directory `assignment3_v2`, so you can check it on gitlab page. We also fixed all bugs and errors in the skeleton codes.

Please read the description on **blackboard** carefully and double-check on the **linux server** before you push.

You have to submit to **<u>this directory</u>**, not `assignment#3` folder.

Please submit **only modified header files**.



Version update log will be updated to `change_log.txt`. 

Please check it carefully and if you have a question please use discussion board on blackboard.
